## Features

- User authentication using Firebase.
- Code translation feature using the OpenAI API.
- Firestore integration to save and retrieve user solutions.
- A clean and responsive user interface designed with Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-clone.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd leetcode-clone
```

3. Install the required dependencies.

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

4. Set up Firebase for authentication and Firestore for data storage. Update the Firebase configuration in the project to connect to your Firebase project.

5. Set up the OpenAI API for code translation. Update the API key in the project to use your OpenAI account.

6. Run the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to access the application.

8. You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). You can customize this endpoint in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*` and is used for creating API routes.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
